# Object Hierarchies, Container Class

#  Win32 Console C++ Relations application II

## Objectivies
Design a console object-oriented C++ application for a ‘relations’ class hierarchy 
consisting of person, relation, uncle, cousin, mother and father classes. Include a 
container class that can contain pointers to any class in the hierarchy. The classes 
should have accessor, mutator, default and overloaded constructor methods. The 
person class should have ‘name’, ‘address’, and ‘phone’ data members. The relations 
class should contain ‘relationship’ and ‘age’ data members. The container class should 
have a method to allow pointers for any object in the hierarchy to be included in the 
container and a print method to print the data associated with any contained object.


**(a)** Draw the UML class diagram. 

**(b)** Develop the C++ class declarations for all classes; 

**(c)** Develop the C++ class method definitions for all classes; 

**(d)** Develop a main driver program that exercises all the features of the application; and

**(e)** Debug, verify and validate your code.
